Version 2.9 of Image::Size has been uploaded to PAUSE, and will propagate
to all CPAN sites over the next few days. Most important is a fix to a
byte-order problem in the BMP support added in 2.8.

To build and install, you will need perl 5.002 or later, and sufficient
access to install an extension.

Summary of Changes in 2.9:

* Support for BMP format in 2.8 was marred by a byte-ordering problem not
  found in testing since my Linux and Windows machines are both Intel-based.
  Sorry.

* Added a contributed fix for a recurring problem with GIF87a images that
  have descriptors similar to GIF89a.

* Added a contributed fix to the PPM matching (prior to actual selection for
  sizing) that was caused by some Win32 versions of Perl not handling "\n"
  natively.

* While at that last one, I made an attempt to fix any MacOS concerns that
  may be triggered by the same consideration.

* Added better error handling to the imgsize script and added a little more
  to the manual page.

From the README file for 2.9:

NOTE: Version 2.9 fixes a bug in the newly-added BMP support from 2.8. The
      2.8 files will be marked for deletion from CPAN. Use this version,
      instead.

Image::Size is a library based on the image-sizing code in the wwwimagesize
script, a tool that analyzes HTML files and adds HEIGHT and WIDTH tags to
IMG directives. Image::Size has generalized that code to return a raw (X, Y)
pair, and included wrappers to pre-format that output into either HTML or a
set of attribute pairs suitable for the CGI.pm library by Lincoln Stein.
Currently, Image::Size can size images in XPM, XBM, GIF, JPEG, TIFF, PNG and
the PPM family of formats (PPM/PGM/PBM).

I did this because my old WWW server generated a lot of documents on demand
rather than keeping them in static files. These documents not only used
directional icons and buttons, but other graphics to annotate and highlight
sections of the text. Without size attributes, browsers cannot render the
text of a page until the image data is loaded and the size known for layout.
This library enables scripts to size their images at run-time and include
that as part of the generated HTML. Or for any other utility that uses and
manipulates graphics. The idea of the basic interface + wrappers is to not
limit the programmer to a certain data format.
