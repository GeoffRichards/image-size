Version 2.5 of Image::Size has been uploaded to PAUSE, and will propagate
to all CPAN sites over the next few days.

To build and install, you will need perl 5.002 or later, and sufficient
access to install an extension.

Summary of Changes in 2.6:

* 2.5 did not actually deliver the tests for the new TIFF code. Oops.

* Found some variations of the formats of XPM and XBM that were not
  compatible with the regex's being used. Tricky, flexible little devils,
  especially XPM.

From the README file for 2.6:

Image::Size is a library based on the image-sizing code in the wwwimagesize
script, a tool that analyzes HTML files and adds HEIGHT and WIDTH tags to
IMG directives. Image::Size has generalized that code to return a raw (X, Y)
pair, and included wrappers to pre-format that output into either HTML or a
set of attribute pairs suitable for the CGI.pm library by Lincoln Stein.
Currently, Image::Size can size images in XPM, XBM, GIF, JPEG, TIFF, PNG and
the PPM family of formats (PPM/PGM/PBM).

I did this because my WWW server generates a lot of documents on demand
rather than keeping them in static files. These documents not only use
directional icons and buttons, but other graphics to annotate and highlight
sections of the text. Without size attributes, browsers cannot render the
text of a page until the image data is loaded and the size known for layout.
This library enables scripts to size their images at run-time and include
that as part of the generated HTML. Or for any other utility that uses and
manipulates graphics. The idea of the basic interface + wrappers is to not
limit the programmer to a certain data format.

Please send any reports of problems or bugs to randy@byz.org. I wouldn't
mind a short note to know that you're using this, just so I can justify its
continued development to my manager :-). (In seriousness, a rough idea of
how many others are using this will help promote its upkeep.)
